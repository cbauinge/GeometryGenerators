# GeometryGenerators
Different C functions to generate certain geometries utilized as test cases for all versions of the IFGF method.


Header only library: just include the headers and use the functions.

Each header represents the generation of one shape.

In the future, there may be a testfile to test if the different geometry generation code are correct.
